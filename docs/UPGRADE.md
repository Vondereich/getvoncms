# VonCMS Upgrade Guide

Most modern VonCMS installs can be updated from the admin panel.

## Recommended path to v1.23.10

1. Back up your database.
2. Back up `uploads/` if you store media locally.
3. If your hosting folder already has a host-generated `.htaccess`, keep a copy before updating.
4. In the admin panel, go to `Settings > System` and run the updater.
5. After the update, verify the homepage, one single post, and the admin dashboard.

## What to verify after updating to v1.23.10

This release line focuses on installer and `.htaccess` safety, admin scalability, media-cleanup review flow, editor/save-path hardening, Database Manager restore clarity, WordPress importer remote-fetch validation, CI/Semgrep cleanup, PHP 8.5/static-analysis cleanup, API key privacy/rotation, Page Manager search parity, media fallback reporting, and vertical video embed fixes carried into the `v1.23.10` baseline.

Check these items:

- the public site loads correctly on your main path
- `/admin` still opens and login works
- one single post page loads without layout glitches
- one public page route resolves correctly
- the editor opens and saves normally for one draft
- search results show correct counts on Digest and Default themes
- Page Manager search returns matching pages from the server
- saved Gemini API keys still work, or prompt for a fresh key if the optional 30-day expiry is enabled and expired
- portrait embeds such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, Facebook Reels, and YouTube Shorts keep a vertical aspect ratio
- comments display numbered pagination (Prev/Next, page buttons)
- if you upload or import images on restrictive hosting, they appear correctly on the frontend (no broken images)
- if you use shared hosting, `.htaccess` still contains your host-managed PHP handler block

## When to use Integrity Fix

Use Integrity Fix only if routing or core protection files are out of sync.

Current behavior:

- it creates a `.bak` backup first
- it repairs the VonCMS-managed routing block
- it is designed to preserve hosting-specific rules outside that managed block

That means it is safer than the older full-overwrite approach.

## Updating from older 1.21.x or earlier installs

If you are coming from an older Breeze or Mandala install:

1. run the normal updater first
2. clear your browser cache
3. open the public homepage and admin once
4. only run Integrity Fix if you actually see routing or protection issues

There is no benefit in pressing Integrity Fix on every update if the site is already healthy.

## Manual upgrade for older installs

If your site is too old for the current OTA flow or the admin panel is unavailable:

1. download the latest release package from the official release
2. back up your database, `uploads/`, and your live `von_config.php`
3. **Delete the `assets/` folder** in your hosting to prevent stale asset conflicts or lingering old files
4. use the latest VonCMS Deploy package and overwrite the existing deployment files
5. if the hosting folder already contains cPanel-generated PHP handlers, custom `.htaccess` blocks, or hardcoded redirects, verify `.htaccess` after extraction and restore your backup or `.bak` copy if needed
6. keep your real `von_config.php` in place and do not replace it with the sample file
7. sign in to the admin panel and verify the system version

## Shared hosting note

A truly fresh install writes a fresh VonCMS `.htaccess` template.

If you are updating inside a folder that already contains hosting-generated `.htaccess` content, custom redirects, or hardcoded rewrite rules, keep a backup of `.htaccess` first and verify the generated `.bak` copy after extraction. This matters most on cPanel or similar hosts that manage PHP versions through `.htaccess` rules.

## Rollback checklist

If something looks wrong after an update:

- restore your database backup if the issue is data-related
- restore your saved `.htaccess` or the `.bak` copy if routing was changed unexpectedly
- restore your `uploads/` backup only if media files are missing or corrupted
- compare your active theme and plugin settings before assuming the core update failed

## Final advice

Update in this order:

1. backup
2. update
3. verify
4. repair only if needed

That keeps the process calm and makes troubleshooting much easier.
