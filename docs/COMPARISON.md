# CMS Comparison Guide 2026

## Let's be honest about what you're actually choosing.

You're not picking a CMS. You're picking your daily workflow for the next few years.

Every choice here has trade-offs. The question is: **which trade-offs match your reality?**

## The honest breakdown

| What matters to you    | VonCMS                                              | WordPress                                                         | Ghost                                                   | Headless CMS                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Hosting cost**       | Shared hosting, $3/month works                      | Shared hosting, $3/month works                                    | Usually needs managed hosting (expensive)               | Separate frontend + backend = double the bill   |
| **How the site feels** | SPA — navigation is instant after first load        | Page reloads every click (unless you pay for heavy customization) | Clean and fast, but still page-driven                   | Whatever your frontend team builds              |
| **Plugin dependency**  | Low — SEO, analytics, newsletter, comments built in | High — most real sites need 15-30 plugins just to function        | Moderate — some things built in, many need integrations | Custom development instead of plugins           |
| **Setup effort**       | Download, upload, install wizard                    | Download, install, then start adding plugins                      | Easy if you use their hosting. Complex if self-hosting  | High — needs developers and deployment pipeline |
| **Who manages it?**    | You, the publisher                                  | You + your plugin ecosystem                                       | You, the writer                                         | Your dev team                                   |
| **Best for**           | Modern publishing on normal hosting                 | Maximum plugin ecosystem                                          | Clean blogging experience                               | Teams with developers and custom requirements   |

## The real conversation nobody has

### "But WordPress has 60,000 plugins!"

Yes. And 80% of them are abandoned, outdated, or security risks. The average WordPress site runs 20-30 plugins. Each one is a dependency you didn't write, can't audit, and must update hoping nothing breaks.

**The question isn't "how many plugins exist?" — it's "how many plugins can you afford to maintain?"**

VonCMS ships with the essentials built in. You're not assembling a working CMS from 15 different strangers' code.

### "But headless is the future!"

It is — if you have a frontend team, a backend team, and a DevOps person. If you're a solo publisher or a small team, "headless" often means "I now manage three repositories, two hosting bills, and a deployment pipeline just to change a blog post."

And there's the bigger question nobody asks: **where does your data actually live?** With most headless platforms, your content sits on their servers, behind their API, under their terms. If they change pricing, shut down, or have an outage — your site goes dark.

**VonCMS is different.** Your database is yours. Your files are yours. Your server is yours. You manage your own data, on your own hosting, with no middleman. If VonCMS disappears tomorrow, your site keeps running. Your data doesn't vanish. You're not locked into anyone's ecosystem.

VonCMS gives you the React frontend experience **without** the headless deployment headache — and **without** handing your content over to a third-party platform. One codebase. One server. Your data. Done.

### "But Ghost is simpler!"

For pure blogging — yes. Ghost is elegant. But the moment you need custom themes beyond their defaults, third-party integrations, or self-hosting on cheap shared hosting — the walls close in. Ghost's extension model is narrow compared to what VonCMS includes out of the box.

## When to pick each platform

### Pick VonCMS when:

- ✅ You want a React-based frontend that feels like an app
- ✅ You want to host on normal PHP hosting (shared, cPanel, $3/month)
- ✅ You want SEO, analytics, newsletter, comments, media management, and themes — all working on day one
- ✅ You're tired of managing 20+ plugins and hoping they don't break each other
- ✅ You run a news site, blog, content portal, or agency delivering client sites
- ✅ You want fewer moving parts than a headless stack

### Pick WordPress when:

- ✅ You need the largest plugin ecosystem on the planet
- ✅ You rely on niche third-party integrations that already exist as WordPress plugins
- ✅ Your team is comfortable maintaining plugin conflicts, security patches, and version updates regularly
- ✅ You're building an ecommerce-first site (WooCommerce is hard to beat)

### Pick Ghost when:

- ✅ Your site is primarily a publication or newsletter
- ✅ You want the smallest, most focused writing experience possible
- ✅ You're fine with a narrower extension surface and fewer customization options
- ✅ You're willing to pay for managed hosting or have Node.js hosting experience

### Pick a headless CMS when:

- ✅ You already have frontend developers building custom applications
- ✅ Multiple channels (web, mobile, IoT) need the same content API
- ✅ You're willing to manage a more complex deployment and hosting story
- ✅ Budget and timeline accommodate custom frontend development
- ✅ You're fine with **your data living on someone else's servers** — because that's what most headless platforms require

## The maintenance cost nobody talks about

The real difference between CMS platforms isn't the download price. **It's what you pay over time — in time, money, and frustration.**

| Platform      | Year 1                                                                                                                                               | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **WordPress** | Cheap install → plugin costs add up → security overhead → maintenance contracts → site gets slow → upgrade hosting → more plugins to fix performance |        |        |
| **Headless**  | Developer time → hosting costs ×2 (frontend + backend) → deployment pipeline → ongoing maintenance → scaling complexity                              |        |        |
| **Ghost**     | Easy start → managed hosting premium pricing → limited customization → eventually outgrow it                                                         |        |        |
| **VonCMS**    | Install → works → OTA updates → minimal maintenance → focus on content                                                                               |        |        |

**VonCMS tries to keep the operating model simple: one publish stack, one hosting target, one codebase.**

Not because it's the easiest to build. Because it's the easiest to **live with**.

## Bottom line

VonCMS isn't trying to replace WordPress for every use case. It's not trying to out-customize a fully headless build. It's not even trying to be the smallest blogging platform.

**It's for people who want a clean publishing workflow, a modern frontend feel, and hosting requirements that stay realistic.**

One more thing: **VonCMS is built for users, not developers.** It doesn't exist to make engineers feel clever. It exists to make publishers feel empowered. Every design decision prioritizes the person who creates content, not the person who writes code. If a feature makes life easier for a non-technical user, it ships. If it only impresses developers, it doesn't.

If that's you — you'll know within the first 10 minutes of using it.
